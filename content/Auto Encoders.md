# Auto Encoders
An important, iconic system in AI classification that involves sending an input through some sort of conversion/encryption tool, then decrypting the result to match the original input as close as possible. The system is fed data of correct conversions, and the system learns the rules of the conversion, and can slowly decipher the code into something similar to the input. Some applications of this technology involves detecting anomalies in datasets, since the expected output would differ highly from the AI output.
