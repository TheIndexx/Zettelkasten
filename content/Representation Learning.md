# Representation/Feature Learning
Method that uses a set of techniques to let the system automatically find features needed for [[Machine Learning]].

**Example**: [[Auto Encoders]]

### Factors of Variation
When creating algorithms to learn features, look for **Factors of Variation**, or different sets of features (typically not observable) that affect observable quantities. Going back to the AI car finder example, FOV's would be the brightness of the sun, color, wheels, etc.
### Overwhelmed...
- Problem #1: Many FOV's influence every piece of data we can observe (wayyyy too many to be useful at all)
	- Solution: Disentangle FOV's, keep only the ones we care about
- Problem #2: How?
	- Solution: [[Deep Learning]]!!
