One of my favorite topics to learn about. The whole concept of machines using the human development of knowledge creates a wonderful connection between biology and technology, 2 unalike fields. There are lots of misconceptions regarding this concept, so the proper definition of AI is simply *the connection between algorithms and datasets to establish patterns.*

## Quick History
Basically, early successes of AI were in very rudimentary settings (IBM AI winning chess championships). But that didn't really mean much, since the rules of those environments were very simply, not like the real world.

Some people tried to hard code the rules of the world into an AI, called the Knowledge Base Approach -> wasn't effective -> shows that machines need to learn knowledge through patterns from raw data
## Answer
[Machine Learning](notes/Machine%20Learning.md)! It successfully yielded "subjective" results that were more attuned to reality
