**Definition**: It's a learning function that maps an input to an output using example input-output pairs. 

### Examples
Lots of money in this field comes from online advertising (ew). These models have gotten really good at predicting what you'll click on given your information. Another example is the housing estimator in [Neural Networks](notes/Neural%20Networks.md). We also see these in photo tagging, speech recognition, machine translation, and autonomous driving. 

- Stuctured Data: Databases of data
	- Eg. Housing price prediction. One column tells you house size/# of bedrooms. Each of the features has a very well defined meaning
	- Most of the current economic value of [Deep Learning](notes/Deep%20Learning.md) is here.

- Unstructured data: Data with no clear meaning
	- Eg. Raw audio, images, text. It's harder for computers to make sense of this data, something humans have evolved to do very well.
	- Thanks to deep learning, computers are much better for these.
