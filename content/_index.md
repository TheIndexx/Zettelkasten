# Zettelkasten
Hello! What you are seeing is my Zettelkasten. It's a tool I plan to use to create hubs of knowledge so I can gravitate away from the mundane structure of normal note-taking. I have no clue what it will look like at the time you are reading this, but hopefully I can grow it from the dark, empty canvas I see right now to something much more comprehensive. 
## Shift to learner
When I consciously pursue knowledge, I often find myself asking a few questions: 
- Am I treating this as a self-assigned chore or a hobby? How can I tell when the shift is made between hobby and chore, and what does this signify?
- Is any of this applicable? If not, what's the point? How do I make this applicable?
- Are there better ways of learning this?

I avoided confronting these subjects because it seemed like a waste of time; at first glance, the scope of these subjects are limited to theory itself. However, purposeful ignorance leads to a lack of certainty and confidence, and I found myself becoming de-motivated to learn and grow as the impact of these questions grew. Starting now, I hope to change that by actively learning what it means to be a learner (no pun intended).

Some of my interests:
- [Artificial Intelligence](ai/Artificial%20Intelligence.md)
- [Self](self/Self.md)

Enjoy!
