Examples A system that decides the salary of employees Would use database with features of employees (hours worked, company title, number of people managed) and their corresponding salaries to create a model Then uses model to assign salaries to future employees Bad data (where datapoints do not correlate to features) gives bad results Logistic Regression: Uses dataset to create mathematical correlations between features and outcomes TLDR: Use good features for good results</description></item><item><title>Representation Learning</title><link>https://theindexx.github.io/notes/Representation-Learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theindexx.github.io/notes/Representation-Learning/</guid><description>Method that uses a set of techniques to let the system automatically find features needed for Machine Learning.
