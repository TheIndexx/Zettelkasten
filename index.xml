The whole concept of machines using the human development of knowledge creates a wonderful connection between biology and technology, 2 unalike fields.</description></item><item><title>Auto Encoders</title><link>https://theindexx.github.io/hub/notes/Auto-Encoders/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theindexx.github.io/hub/notes/Auto-Encoders/</guid><description>An important, iconic system in AI classification that involves sending an input through some sort of conversion/encryption tool, then decrypting the result to match the original input as close as possible.</description></item><item><title>Binary Classification</title><link>https://theindexx.github.io/hub/notes/Binary-classification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theindexx.github.io/hub/notes/Binary-classification/</guid><description>Algorithm where output is either 0 or 1 (could symbolize true/false, yes/no).
Example We got a 64x64 pixel cat picture. Input is picture, output is either 1 (cat) or 0 (no cat) In order to make this more processable for the algorithm, we break the picture into 3 matrices of pixel values for each Red, Green, and Blue pixel.</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning</title><link>https://theindexx.github.io/hub/notes/Deep-Learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theindexx.github.io/hub/notes/Deep-Learning/</guid><description>Representations in terms of more representations (inception type vibe).

Examples A system that decides the salary of employees Would use database with features of employees (hours worked, company title, number of people managed) and their corresponding salaries to create a model Then uses model to assign salaries to future employees Bad data (where datapoints do not correlate to features) gives bad results Logistic Regression: Uses dataset to create mathematical correlations between features and outcomes TLDR: Use good features for good results</description></item><item><title>Multi-Layer Perceptron</title><link>https://theindexx.github.io/hub/notes/Multi-Layer-Perceptron/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theindexx.github.io/hub/notes/Multi-Layer-Perceptron/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Neural Networks</title><link>https://theindexx.github.io/hub/notes/Neural-Networks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theindexx.github.io/hub/notes/Neural-Networks/</guid><description>Explanation At its most basic form, a neural network is just a series of nodes that are connected together, inspired by how neurons work in humans.</description></item><item><title>Representation Learning</title><link>https://theindexx.github.io/hub/notes/Representation-Learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theindexx.github.io/hub/notes/Representation-Learning/</guid><description>Method that uses a set of techniques to let the system automatically find features needed for Machine Learning.
